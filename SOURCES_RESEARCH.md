## Implementation Notes

Adding torrent sites requires:
1. **Legal Considerations**: Torrent sites are often in legal gray areas
2. **Site Availability**: Many torrent sites change domains frequently
3. **Scraping Complexity**: Torrent sites often have anti-bot measures
4. **User Safety**: Need to warn users about risks

## Recommendation

The app already has comprehensive DDL (Direct Download) coverage across all major categories. Adding torrent sites would:
- Increase legal risk
- Require additional anti-bot bypass mechanisms
- Need frequent maintenance due to domain changes
- May not add significant value over existing DDL sources

**Suggested Approach**: Focus on maintaining and improving existing sources rather than adding torrent sites. If users need torrents, they can use dedicated torrent search engines.

## Sources to Prioritize

Instead of torrent sites, consider adding:
1. More DDL sites for existing categories
2. Specialized niche sources
3. Multi-language content sources
4. Better quality/verified sources

## User Feedback

Monitor user requests and community feedback to determine which sources are most needed.
